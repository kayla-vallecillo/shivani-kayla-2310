                    <p style="line-height: 1.4; width: 70%;">Whether you’re looking to spice up your cooking with
                        new cultural recipes or you’re interested in exploring obscure topics within your research
                        field, Interlibrary Loans give WPI students access to a vast world of knowledge. The George
                        C. Gordon Library’s Interlibrary Loan (ILLiad) program allows students to request resources
                        that are unavailable within the physical and digital confines of the Gordon Library.<br><br>

                        Yet amongst a vast network of articles, books, journals, and archived media which lies at
                        our fingertips through ILLiad, many students may feel apprehensive or overwhelmed by this
                        process. Just as explorers used maps and visual guides to brave seas and navigate
                        challenging terrain, we’ve decided to take a similar approach to exploring the expansive
                        resources available through the Gordon Library and ILLiad program.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.4; width: 70%;">To begin our design process, we’re looking back at the
                        fundamentals of map-making and visual geographic guides. By adding visual components, like
                        color, texture, and small, seemingly microscopic details, the historical maps we’re
                        referencing seem to blend intricate design choices with generally accurate renditions of
                        physical space. Through adding a compass, written text, and intentional curves and lines to
                        represent land masses, seas, and rivers, the creators of the map featured above utilized
                        fine artistry and their understanding of the geographic landscape to create a product that
                        was readable, educational, and visually engaging.<br>

                        We’ve also investigated how maps can be utilized as a form of visual storytelling. In
                        the medley of multimedia art, infographic, and map elements featured in the image above,
                        artist and storyteller Alice Feagan encapsulates both the physical, geographical, and social
                        components that compose the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Through a graphic
                        that blends a variety of media and communication forms, the viewer can grasp the cultural
                        meanings behind physical spaces that contribute to this community and experience. Now that
                        we’ve understood that maps can be utilized as a method of communication beyond just physical
                        and geographical content, we’re looking back at our Unit 2 readings to develop effective
                        visually communicative content.<br><br>

                        As outlined by statistician Edward Tufte in his chapter “Visual and Statistical Thinking:
                        Displays of Evidence for Making Decisions” from Envisioning Information (1990), charts are
                        weak unless data is placed in the appropriate context for cause and effect (Tufte 29). In
                        order to effectively communicate how students may navigate the process of receiving an
                        Interlibrary Loan at the Gordon Library, our outlined steps must be clear and
                        straightforward as well as causally related to the end goal. In this instance, our goal is
                        to show the steps of using the Interlibrary Loan to inform them and make it an approachable
                        resource. With this in mind, we’re using a map that looks similar to a road, not to reflect
                        physical or geographical information, but rather to display chronology–appealing to the
                        causational system we’ve constructed through exploring the Gordon Library’s website.<br><br>

                        Tufte also highlights that if information is not presented credibly, extrinsic pressures may
                        influence the perception and use of its informational content (Tufte 52). While the
                        importance of our information is far different from the critical information that could have
                        prevented the tragic explosion of the Challenger space shuttle, our information must be
                        communicated in a way that appeals to the credibility of the information we’re hoping to
                        convey. If we utilized cartoon-style typefaces and low-contrast text and background
                        combinations, the failure of our work to visually convey the ILLiad process. That’s why
                        we’ve decided to use a roadmap with bright, contrasting colors that can be read quickly and
                        with ease, further encouraging students to use the interlibrary loan–without making it
                        appear intimidating or hard to navigate.<br><br>

                        Just as rhetorician Rudolf Arnheim described in his chapter “Pictures, Symbols, and Signs,”
                        within Visual Rhetoric in a Digital World: A Critical Sourcebook (2004), we plan to employ
                        the use of varying levels of abstraction within our images to build an engaging,
                        understandable, and cohesive product. Through understanding the role of symbols as images
                        that portray things at a higher level of abstractness than that which the symbol exists
                        within (Arnheim 139), like pins and speech bubbles, we’ve decided to incorporate similar
                        components in our own design. The combination of non-abstract images, like scrapbook-style
                        paper strips and a map background, as well as symbols like map pins and a road shape, our
                        use of multi-faceted abstraction of images will allow us to create a product that yields a
                        dynamic quality.<br><br>

                        Through our research and investigations of visual communication mechanisms, we’ve designed a
                        mix of maps, timelines, and scrapbooks to create a cohesive visual product that details the
                        steps readers should take to acquire their own Interlibrary Loans. This product makes ILLiad
                        easy to navigate and the expansive pool of resources available to WPI students slightly more
                        accessible.<br><br>
