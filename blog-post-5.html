                    <p style="line-height: 1.4; width: 70%;">WPI’s Gordon Library is home to a profoundly vast selection
                        of literary works and modern and contemporary knowledge, yet the library encourages students to
                        capture their innovative goals and dreams and explore beyond what the Gordon library has to
                        offer. The ILLiad service, better known as the inter-library loan service program, is a simple,
                        yet daunting service that allows students and professors to access an entire “universe” of
                        knowledge that was once out of their reach.
                        <br><br>

                        Additionally, the Gordon Library provides resources to assist students in both their academic
                        and non-academic pursuits. Yet, these resources remain unused as many students are unaware of
                        them or may face apprehensions in getting involved with new library programs. With this in mind,
                        we aimed to include the most relevant resources in our infographic, leaving students prepared to
                        tackle their research, writing, and problem-solving with one quick glance.
                        <br><br>

                        In our first iteration, we produced an infographic that employs high contrast text and colors,
                        bright visuals and symbols, resembling the style of a map. Not only did the map format highlight
                        the steps of navigating ILLiad in chronological order, but it portrayed a level of abstractness
                        higher than itself, allowing it to represent the exploration of knowledge and, thus, the idea of
                        progress, as suggested by rhetorician Rudolf Arnheim (Arnheim 139).<br><br>
                    </p>

                    <img src="Pictures/2.1.png" style="width: 70%;">

                    <p style="line-height: 1.4; width: 70%;">However, in presenting our initial draft to the class, a
                        major flaw was pointed out: the infographic did not explain what ILLiad is or why students
                        should use it. As highlighted by statistician Edward Tufte in his chapter “Visual and
                        Statistical Thinking: Displays of Evidence for Making Decisions” from Envisioning Information
                        (1990), data should be placed in the context of causation, or it fails to achieve anything
                        (Tufte 29). While our graphic clearly outlined how ILLiad should be utilized, we did not appeal
                        to the cause–the why.<br><br>

                        On top of this, our first iteration did not include other library resources, nor presented
                        itself as logical in the way in which it was read. Our roadmap began at the top right,
                        countering the traditional left to right reading method. To make our navigation mechanism more
                        effective, we decided to flip our map path in order to make our infographic more intuitively
                        digestible.<br><br>

                        In our second iteration, we began by flipping the orientation, so that the reader begins on the
                        left, making for an easier read. The most substantial addition was that of a second page. This
                        page incorporated various signifiers in the form of abstract shapes, providing movement. The
                        shadows make them appear as coming off the page, providing a sense of “realness” and
                        perspective, as well as an energizing feeling and engagement towards using the resources
                        described. Rhetorical strategies such as underlining were employed, to direct the viewer to the
                        purpose of each descriptive bubble.
                        <br>
                    </p>

                </div>

                <img src="Pictures/2.2.png" style="width: 70%; margin-left: 15%;">

                <div style="margin-left: 25%;">

                    <p style="line-height: 1.4; width: 70%;">

                        Upon further analysis, we recognized that the text as a whole was redundant and lacked
                        persuasive devices which could encourage WPI students to use these resources. For the final
                        iteration, we honed in on this effect, adjusting our language and selection of resources to
                        better appeal to the WPI community. For the information that we believed would convince students
                        to take action, we used cohesive, yet independently unique visuals to make the information stand
                        out.<br><br>

                        On the front page of our final version, we decided to add a sort of “journey statement,” which
                        aims to ask a question that may resonate with passing viewers. By adding a cute, cartoony book
                        and an arrow pointing to its question, we aimed to appeal to the inviting, comfortable nature of
                        the library as well as its compelling ILLiad alternative. While an arrow seems simple in its
                        nature, its placement, uniqueness relative to the entire visual design, and symbolism of a new
                        but related idea draws the viewer to it, leading them to the primary reason and typical cause
                        justifying why they should consider checking out the inter-library loan program. Moreover, we
                        changed our databases section to the writing center, as it is less known and more helpful in the
                        eyes of students.<br><br>
                    </p>

                    <p style="line-height: 1.4; width: 70%;">
                        Through these changes and inspirations from several rhetoricians and authors, we produced a
                        final product which we feel is both representative of the library and properly appeals to the
                        exciting world available to WPI students through the ILLiad program.
