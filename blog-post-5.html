                    <p style="line-height: 1.4; width: 70%;">WPI’s Gordon Library is home to a profoundly vast selection
                        of literary works and modern and contemporary knowledge, yet the library encourages students to
                        capture their innovative goals and dreams and explore beyond what the Gordon library has to
                        offer. The ILLiad service, better known as the inter-library loan service program, is a simple,
                        yet daunting service that allows students and professors to access an entire “universe” of
                        knowledge that was once out of their reach.
                        <br><br>

                        Additionally, the Gordon Library provides resources to assist students in both their academic
                        and non-academic pursuits. Yet, these resources remain unused as many students are unaware of
                        them or may face apprehensions in getting involved with new library programs. With this in mind,
                        we aimed to include the most relevant resources in our infographic, leaving students prepared to
                        tackle their research, writing, and problem-solving with one quick glance.
                        <br><br>

                        In our first iteration, we produced an infographic that employs high contrast text and colors,
                        bright visuals and symbols, resembling the style of a map. Not only did the map format highlight
                        the steps of navigating ILLiad in chronological order, but it portrayed a level of abstractness
                        higher than itself, allowing it to represent the exploration of knowledge and, thus, the idea of
                        progress, as suggested by rhetorician Rudolf Arnheim (Arnheim 139).<br><br>
                    </p>

                    <img src="Pictures/2.1.png" style="width: 70%;">

                    <p style="line-height: 1.4; width: 70%;">However, in presenting our initial draft to the class, a
                        major flaw was pointed out: the infographic did not explain what ILLiad is or why students
                        should use it. As highlighted by statistician Edward Tufte in his chapter “Visual and
                        Statistical Thinking: Displays of Evidence for Making Decisions” from Envisioning Information
                        (1990), data should be placed in the context of causation, or it fails to achieve anything
                        (Tufte 29). While our graphic clearly outlined how ILLiad should be utilized, we did not appeal
                        to the cause–the why.<br><br>

                        On top of this, our first iteration did not include other library resources, nor presented
                        itself as logical in the way in which it was read. Our roadmap began at the top right,
                        countering the traditional left to right reading method. To make our navigation mechanism more
                        effective, we decided to flip our map path in order to make our infographic more intuitively
                        digestible.<br><br>

                        In our second iteration, we began by flipping the orientation, so that the reader begins on the
                        left, making for an easier read. The most substantial addition was that of a second page. This
                        page incorporated various signifiers in the form of abstract shapes, providing movement. The
                        shadows make them appear as coming off the page, providing a sense of “realness” and
                        perspective, as well as an energizing feeling and engagement towards using the resources
                        described. Rhetorical strategies such as underlining were employed, to direct the viewer to the
                        purpose of each descriptive bubble.

                        We’ve also investigated how maps can be utilized as a form of visual storytelling. In
                        the medley of multimedia art, infographic, and map elements featured in the image above,
                        artist and storyteller Alice Feagan encapsulates both the physical, geographical, and social
                        components that compose the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Through a graphic
                        that blends a variety of media and communication forms, the viewer can grasp the cultural
                        meanings behind physical spaces that contribute to this community and experience. Now that
                        we’ve understood that maps can be utilized as a method of communication beyond just physical
                        and geographical content, we’re looking back at our Unit 2 readings to develop effective
                        visually communicative content.<br><br>

                        As outlined by statistician Edward Tufte in his chapter “Visual and Statistical Thinking:
                        Displays of Evidence for Making Decisions” from Envisioning Information (1990), charts are
                        weak unless data is placed in the appropriate context for cause and effect (Tufte 29). In
                        order to effectively communicate how students may navigate the process of receiving an
                        Interlibrary Loan at the Gordon Library, our outlined steps must be clear and
                        straightforward as well as causally related to the end goal. In this instance, our goal is
                        to show the steps of using the Interlibrary Loan to inform them and make it an approachable
                        resource. With this in mind, we’re using a map that looks similar to a road, not to reflect
                        physical or geographical information, but rather to display chronology–appealing to the
                        causational system we’ve constructed through exploring the Gordon Library’s website.<br><br>

                        Tufte also highlights that if information is not presented credibly, extrinsic pressures may
                        influence the perception and use of its informational content (Tufte 52). While the
                        importance of our information is far different from the critical information that could have
                        prevented the tragic explosion of the Challenger space shuttle, our information must be
                        communicated in a way that appeals to the credibility of the information we’re hoping to
                        convey. If we utilized cartoon-style typefaces and low-contrast text and background
                        combinations, the failure of our work to visually convey the ILLiad process. That’s why
                        we’ve decided to use a roadmap with bright, contrasting colors that can be read quickly and
                        with ease, further encouraging students to use the interlibrary loan–without making it
                        appear intimidating or hard to navigate.<br><br>

                        Just as rhetorician Rudolf Arnheim described in his chapter “Pictures, Symbols, and Signs,”
                        within Visual Rhetoric in a Digital World: A Critical Sourcebook (2004), we plan to employ
                        the use of varying levels of abstraction within our images to build an engaging,
                        understandable, and cohesive product. Through understanding the role of symbols as images
                        that portray things at a higher level of abstractness than that which the symbol exists
                        within (Arnheim 139), like pins and speech bubbles, we’ve decided to incorporate similar
                        components in our own design. The combination of non-abstract images, like scrapbook-style
                        paper strips and a map background, as well as symbols like map pins and a road shape, our
                        use of multi-faceted abstraction of images will allow us to create a product that yields a
                        dynamic quality.<br><br>

                        Through our research and investigations of visual communication mechanisms, we’ve designed a
                        mix of maps, timelines, and scrapbooks to create a cohesive visual product that details the
                        steps readers should take to acquire their own Interlibrary Loans. This product makes ILLiad
                        easy to navigate and the expansive pool of resources available to WPI students slightly more
                        accessible.<br><br>
