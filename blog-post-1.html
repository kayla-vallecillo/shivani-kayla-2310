                        <p style="line-height: 1.4;">Hello! <br><br>We’re Shivani and Kayla, and we will be documenting
                            our journey in visual
                            rhetoric
                            through
                            this blog! To learn more about us, check out our “Meet the Team” page.

                            Having known each other previously, we have bonded over familiarity and are excited to work
                            with
                            each other this term! To maintain organization while being flexible, we have been updating
                            each
                            other with assignment progress daily, and it has been working well for us! We have been able
                            to
                            communicate quickly and effectively via text, getting our questions answered right away and
                            leaning on each other for support when needed. At the beginning of each assignment, we
                            create a
                            vague plan and delegate right after class, and continue with individual work, with a few
                            checkpoints along the way.

                            <br><br>Thank you for reading our first post! Come back next week for more updates :)
