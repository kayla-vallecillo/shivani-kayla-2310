                    <p style="line-height: 1.4; width: 70%;"> Hidden deep within the depths of inked outlines,
                        watercolor
                        textures, and thematic fantasia storylines, “Spells & Scrolls: Unlocking Gordonlibraria’s Hidden
                        Treasures” is our attempt at bringing a fun, creative twist to the Gordon Library’s Interlibrary
                        Loan program (ILLiad). <br>

                        life!<br></p>

                    <p style="line-height: 1.4; width: 70%;">Inspired heavily by Scott McCloud’s “Show and Tell,” a
                        chapter within <i>Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art</i> (1993), our comic blends smooth
                        linework
                        and detailed shading patterns with muted watercolors inspired by a comic from a 1928 edition of
                        the <i>Chicago Sunday Tribune</i>’s “Gasoline Alley.” While our stylistic choices were defined
                        by this
                        blend, the way in which we built relationships between text and picture are directly derived
                        from McCloud’s narrative style and categorically defined relationships which span
                        interdependence and additive combinations (McCloud 153-155). In “Show and Tell,” McCloud defines
                        examples and descriptions of these text-picture relationships, each combination providing us
                        with a reference for how our story may be communicated in interesting and strategic ways.
                        <br><br>

                        Using this resource, we incorporated combinations like montage, which integrates text into a
                        picture’s visual elements. We also used word-specific combinations, where pictures illustrate a
                        more complete textual description. Using these mechanisms, as described by McCloud, we were able
                        to produce a comic that integrates creative storylines and unique text-picture combinations that
                        aim to keep the reader engaged as they take this alternate route towards the library’s
                        information.<br>

                        In our first version of the comic, we used rough sketching and blocking to lay out the first
                        half of our storyline and began incorporating McCloud’s text-picture combinations. This draft
                        was left mostly unfinished, but served as a guide for a more refined version.

                    <p style="line-height: 1.4; width: 70%;"><br>In our second version, we began the tedious process of
                        “inking” our pages, or adding more defined
                        lines, colors, and shading to our comic to bring a more refined look to our initial sketches.
                        This included determining a color scheme, which we decided would be largely inspired by the
                        color wheel located at the top left of our “Gasoline Alley” reference. In Design 3.2, we also
                        completed the storyline, which served as an opportunity for us to re-read our comic and grasp
                        the message completely while understanding where pockets of information might get lost or
                        crowded. In our second version, we also noticed a distinct difference in our artistic styles,
                        but in order to maintain an equal level of contribution to the artistic portions of this comic,
                        we decided to continue with splitting up the pages (where Kayla draws the first four pages and
                        Shivani draws the last three) while communicating thoroughly to ensure that our artistic styles
                        do not clash. This involved determining consistent line widths, watercolor textures, and color
                        schemes. While our storyline was complete in Design 3.2, it left us with several “un-inked”
                        pages of hand-drawn details and strategically-textured watercolor components.<br>
                    </p>

                    <p style="line-height: 1.4; width: 70%;">

                        In our final version, we adjusted our comic slightly to account for comments from the in-class
                        peer review session. With many of our peers anticipating a more complete version in the final
                        design, we did receive comments about the spacing and size of our letters as well as our
                        creative uses of space and boxes as methods for communicating information. Using these comments,
                        we adjusted several textboxes and maintained an emphasis on these creative spatial ideas. Some
                        comments suggested that information about ILLiad be placed sooner in our comic to reduce the
                        amount of reading one must do to obtain this important logistical information. While this could
                        have been an effective change to our design, we decided after discussion that the purpose of our
                        story is to provide a fun and interesting fantasy-themed outlet for WPI students which
                        seamlessly blends this information throughout the story rather than explicitly describing the
                        steps. We determined that straightforward usage steps are more closely linked to the function of
                        infographics and lists, a decision that we feel leaves our final version as an interesting and
                        engaging story with an added informational bonus.<br></p>

                        Our comic is centered upon McCloud’s creative storytelling strategies and Appignanesi and
                        Zarate’s use of visual information guides like diagrams, illustrations, and examples in <i>Freud
                            for Beginners</i> (2003), a comic where the authors guide readers through Sigmund Freud’s
                        philosophical and psychological ideas on impulse, conscious desire, civilization, ego, and the
                        reduction of tension. During our initial reads, the topics described by Appignanesi and Zarate
                        were complex and advanced, however in using strategic visual components, the information was
                        made digestible and engaging. Our comic aims to follow a similar path, where the often confusing
                        logistical steps of signing up for ILLiad are communicated effectively through lava-surrounded
                        rock paths and spellbinding poetic URLs.<br><br>

                        While our comic still leaves room for refinement and re-tweakings of our pacing and diversity of
                        text-picture relationships, we find that this tediously hand-drawn work serves as a testament to
                        our dedication and willingness to experiment with new mediums. In reading our final draft, we
                        hope you enjoy your tour of Gordonlibraria, and take our spellbound knowledge with you as you
                        explore a vast collection of knowledge available through this program.<br>
