                    <section>
                        <p style="line-height: 1.4; width: 70%;"><i>Veritas</i> is a typeface designed with the
                            intention of immersing
                            readers into the world held within WPI’s George C. Gordon Library. Amidst shelves upon
                            shelves of academic texts and corners and workspaces that source much of WPI’s innovation
                            and collaboration, we feel that our font properly reflects this influential space.<br><br>

                            Aiming to showcase this along with the welcoming spirit of Gordon, we present a font that is
                            fresh, inviting, but credible all at once, leaving the viewer engaged and excited to step
                            into the library. As the Gorgon C. Library’s digital and printed resources vary between
                            their use of serif and sans serif typefaces, which either fluctuate between feeling too
                            academic and formal and being slightly uninviting and modern, we’ve decided to take on the
                            challenge of creating a new typeface which mirrors the credibility and high level of
                            academic and intellectual excellence at WPI, yet the inviting nature of the library’s
                            physical space and role as an entity which fuels collaboration and in building friendship
                            and community.<br><br>

                            Initially, we looked at fonts from other libraries, including the Boston Public Library and
                            the Yale Library, to note parts of their style that we enjoyed: the round aspects,
                            cleanness, and white space. We found that the lack of serifs and plainness of the Boston
                            Public Library’s text attributed to a kind of mundane energy. Hence, we opted for a design
                            that has flares and serifs while balancing a <i>bubbly</i> style.<br><br>
                        </p>

                        <img src="Pictures/libraries.png" style="width: 70%;">

                        <p style="line-height: 1.4; width: 70%;">In our first iteration, we split up the capitals and
                            lowercase, resulting in the lowercase exemplifying a bubbly effect while the capital letters
                            utilized heavy serifs. Our periods and dots on letters were a bit rounder, replicating a
                            flame and candles as a symbol of enlightenment and intellectual vitality. In peer review, we
                            learned that our serifs were too heavy or too light, and the inconsistency of these details
                            undermined the credibility we attempted to appeal to. We displayed effective appeals to
                            collaboration and innovation but failed to show the academic setting which this community
                            resides in as well. To combat this, we used a new tool and made our serifs smaller, rounder,
                            and more consistent lines (unless the letter was curved).<br><br>

                            In our second iteration, we primarily aimed to smooth our letters and aim for a more
                            “refined” look. To do this, we both downloaded the digital tool Inkscape, which is
                            comparable to Adobe Illustrator, and allowed us to use shapes, lines, and node-based digital
                            design tools to create smooth, professional-looking drawings. After we both contributed to
                            the smoothing and refinement of each letter, we were left with <i>Veritas</i> V2, a bubbly yet
                            slightly imperfect version that still left us with improvements to be made in the
                            consistency of our serifs and the smoothness and width of our letters.<br>

                            <br>Visual rhetoricians Benton and Gutjahr highlight that fonts are characterized as masculine
                            and aristocratic for their boldness (Benton & Gutjahr 80). While including this, we also
                            added the highly popularized academic serifs and the use of empty space (which is
                            characterized as feminine) to combat misogynistic stereotypes in academia (Benton & Gutjahr
                            72-74). The serifs continue to contribute to the academic setting of the library, as fonts,
                            including serifs such as Times New Roman, are often used in research papers and scientific
                            texts. As described by Roland Barthes in “Image-Music-Text,” the denoted message is taken at
                            face value; hence, the circles and round shapes may provide a sense of movement to our font
                            and highlight WPI’s unity, a symbol relevant to the fact that circles have no end (Barthes
                            45).
                        </p>

                        <img src="Pictures/final_blurb.png" style="width: 70%;">

                        <p style="line-height: 1.4; width: 70%;">In our final version, which is pictured above, we used
                            Inkscape and followed online tutorials to continue refining our font smoothness,
                            consistency, and overall shape, structure, and spacing. Our final design utilizes curves,
                            fillets, smooth details, and serifs to appeal to the library’s emotional and communal role
                            as a safe space and inviting, collaborative place, as well as the academia-style influences
                            of a Roman typeface. We aimed to encapsulate the centricity of enlightenment and academia
                            through our incorporation of “Garamond”-style Roman texts that are associated with
                            intellectual Renaissance and scholastic growth (Benton & Gutjahr 9). We also used curves and
                            bubbly serifs to make our font inviting and engaging for use in library media.<br><br>

                            Due to the bold nature of our typeface, its main use is on flyers to catch the reader's
                            attention, especially in places crowded with flyers (similar to the bulletin boards near
                            Unity Hall elevators). The capitals can serve as inviting headers, while the bold lowercase
                            can be used for the main text, highlighting important info or subheadings. It can be printed
                            or used online however, we would not use it outside of advertising as overuse can give a
                            juvenile tone.<br><br>


                            <i>Veritas</i>, Latin for “truth,” is our take on truth, enlightenment, growth, and collaboration.
                            <br><br>
                            Enjoy!!
