                    <section>
                        <p style="line-height: 1.4; width: 70%;"><i>Veritas</i> is a typeface designed with the
                            intention of immersing
                            readers into the world held within WPI’s George C. Gordon Library. Amidst shelves upon
                            shelves of academic texts and corners and workspaces that source much of WPI’s innovation
                            and collaboration, we feel that our font properly reflects this influential space.<br><br>

                            Aiming to showcase this along with the welcoming spirit of Gordon, we present a font that is
                            fresh, inviting, but credible all at once, leaving the viewer engaged and hoping to step
                            into the library. As the Gorgon C. Library’s digital and printed resources vary between
                            their use of serif and sans serif typefaces, which either fluctuate between feeling too
                            academic and formal and being slightly uninviting and modern, we’ve decided to take on the
                            challenge of creating a new typeface which mirrors the credibility and high level of
                            academic and intellectual excellence at WPI, yet the inviting nature of the library’s
                            physical space and role as an entity which fuels collaboration and building friendship and
                            community.<br><br>

                            Initially, we looked at fonts from other libraries, including the Boston Public Library and
                            the Yale Library, to note parts of their style that we enjoyed: the round aspects,
                            cleanness, and white space. We found that the lack of serifs and plainness attributed to the
                            mundane energy hence, we opted for a design that has flares of serifs on some letters and a
                            <i>bubbly</i> style.<br><br>
                        </p>

                        <img src="Pictures/libraries.png" style="width: 70%;">

                        <p style="line-height: 1.4; width: 70%;">In our first iteration, we split up the capitals and
                            lowercase, having the lowercase
                            exemplify the bubbly effect and the capitals with heavy serifs. Our periods and dots on
                            letters were a bit rounder, replicating a flame and candles as a symbol of enlightenment and
                            intelligence. In peer review, we learned that our serifs were too heavy or too light, and
                            the inconsistency took away from the credibility we attempted to appeal to. We appealed to
                            collaboration and innovation but failed to show the academic setting present as well. In
                            order to combat this, we used a new tool and made our serifs so that they were small lines
                            (unless the letter was curved).<br><br>

                            In our second iteration, we primarily aimed to smooth our letters and aim for a more
                            “refined” look. To do this, we both downloaded the digital tool Inkscape, which is
                            comparable to Adobe Illustrator, and allows users to use shapes, lines, and node-based
                            digital design to create smooth, professional-looking drawings. After we both contributed to
                            the smoothing and refinement of each letter, we were left with Veritas V2, a bubbly yet
                            slightly imperfect version which still left us with improvements to be made in the
                            consistency of our serifs and the smoothness and consistent width of our letters.<br><br>

                            Visual rhetoricians Benton and Gutjahr highlight that fonts are characterized as masculine
                            and aristocratic for their boldness (Benton & Gutjahr 80). While including this, we added
                            the highly popularized serifs and empty space, which is characterized as feminine, to combat
                            misogynistic stereotypes in academia (Benton & Gutjahr 72-74). The serifs continue to
                            contribute to the academic setting of the library, as fonts, including serifs such as Times
                            New Roman, are often used in research papers. As described by Rolan Barthe in
                            “Image-Music-Text,” the denoted message is taken at face value–hence, the circles at face
                            value may provide movement to our font and highlight unity as circles have no end.</p>

                        <img src="Pictures/final_blurb.png" style="width: 70%;">

                        <p style="line-height: 1.4; width: 70%;">In our final version, which is pictured above, we used Inkscape and followed online tutorials
                            to continue refining our font smoothness, consistency, and overall shape, structure, and
                            spacing. Our final design utilizes curves, fillets, smooth details, and serifs to appeal to
                            the library’s emotional and communal role as a safe space and inviting collaborative place,
                            as well as the academia-style influences of a Roman typeface. We aimed to encapsulate the
                            centricity of enlightenment and academia through our incorporation of “Garamond”-style Roman
                            texts that are associated with Renaissance and scholastic growth (Benton & Gutjahr 9). We
                            used curves and bubbly serifs to make our font inviting and engaging for use in library
                            media.<br><br>

                            Due to the bold nature of our typeface, its main use is on flyers to catch the reader's
                            attention, especially in places crowded with flyers (similar to the bulletin boards near
                            Unity Hall elevators). The capitals can serve as inviting headers, while the bold lowercase
                            can be used for the main text, highlighting important info or subheadings. It can be printed
                            or used online however, we would not use it outside of advertising as overuse can give a
                            juvenile tone.<br><br>


                            Veritas, Latin for “truth,” is our take on truth, enlightenment, growth, and collaboration.
