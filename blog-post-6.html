                    <p style="line-height: 1.4; width: 70%;">Whether you grew up reading comics and graphic novels like
                        <i>The Adventures of Captain Underpants</i> or the <i>Amazing Spider-Man</i>, it’s clear that
                        image-heavy
                        texts have played an influential role in the literary growth and entertainment of many across
                        the world. The unifying nature of comic-style texts leads us on an exploration of how this art
                        form may be utilized in conveying stories, ideas, and instructions that may guide viewers
                        through information more intuitively.
                        <br><br>

                        In Design 2, we developed an infographic inspired by maps and scrapbooks to inform the WPI
                        community about the countless resources available to them within the library and beyond through
                        the Gordon Library’s Interlibrary Loan program (ILLiad). We plan to extend our intentions of
                        highlighting the profoundly vast selection of academic and non-academic knowledge available to
                        students through a new design medium–<b>comics</b>!

                        <br><br>

                        To start, we’re referencing the lessons we’ve learned through reading Scott McCloud’s “Show and
                        Tell,” a chapter within <i>Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art</i> (1993). McCloud uses
                        visually
                        engaging, comic-style illustrations and several methods of written text integration to inform
                        readers about the virtually infinite creative possibilities available through understanding the
                        historical and contemporary relationships between words and pictures. In our comic, we hope to
                        take a similar approach to McCloud, integrating a narrator, engaging (and even comedic)
                        examples, storytelling, and unique visual elements (like scraps of text, charts, diagrams,
                        poetry, and more).<br>
                    </p>

                    <img src="Pictures/mccloud1.png" style="width: 70%;">
                    <p style="font-size: 20px; width: 70%;">An example of McCloud’s use of narrating, examples, and art
                        to describe a stage within the changing nature of modern art (McCloud 150).<br></p>

                    <p style="line-height: 1.4; width: 70%;">McCloud also draws examples of the various ways in which
                        words and pictures can be combined and related to enhance storytelling and forge powerful
                        narratives. From word-specific to interdependent, words and pictures possess a variety of
                        relationships which can completely alter the structure and tone of the information being
                        expressed (McCloud 152-155). In our comic, we intend to emphasize the use of word- and
                        picture-specific relationships so that either medium can enhance the reader’s immersion into the
                        story. Through montage and interdependence, we hope to add character and style to our comic,
                        creating a product that is unique yet intuitive and understandable. We’ve also taken heavy
                        inspiration from the storytelling-centric style that McCloud employs, a strategy that we intend
                        to employ throughout our comic by guiding readers through an immersive journey.
                        <br><br>

                        Through extending our map and journey-inspired informational expressions in Design 2, we’re
                        hoping to use fantasy-style storytelling to tell a tale about a WPI student who is given a quest
                        through the lands of “Gordonlibraria,” a fictional, yet expansive land possessing magical
                        forests which hold thousands of years worth of information. With the intention of acquiring a
                        priceless manuscript from a faraway land, the protagonist embarks on a journey through the
                        treacherous paths of Gordonlibraria, challenged with tackling small challenges, like whispering
                        information-packed spells to enchanted forests which reveal new paths towards the manuscript’s
                        destination. Through mirroring the registration process WPI students use to request an
                        Interlibrary Loan, we hope that this engaging, mythical tale inspires students to explore the
                        vast stretches of knowledge available to them through this program.<br><br>

                        Using bright colors and digital watercolor details inspired by the “Gasoline Alley” comic strips
                        of the 1920s, we’re hoping to illustrate simple, yet visually tasteful landscapes of
                        Gordonlibraria.<br>
                        <br>
                    </p>

                        In McCloud’s “Google on Google Chrome” (2008), the use of pastel blue details and a background
                        adds dimension and character to the comic. Instead of using black and white or harsh colors to
                        fill empty space, we’re hoping to add text, diagrams, or color where objects reside. Through
                        using creative characters, diagrams, and visually appealing illustrations, McCloud effectively
                        conveys the structural components which allow Google Chrome to function effectively.<br><br></p>

                    <p style="font-size: 20px; width: 70%;">McCloud’s use of diagrams, characters, maps, and narrative

                        “Google on Google Chrome” inspired us to incorporate color, diagrams, and creative details into
                        our piece to create an approachable blend of information and immersive storytelling. Appignanesi
                        and Zarate follow similar storytelling strategies in Freud for Beginners (2003), where the
                        authors and illustrators use diagrams, illustrations, and examples to guide readers through
                        Sigmund Freud’s philosophical and psychological ideas on impulse, conscious desire,
                        civilization, ego, and the reduction of tension. While these topics were advanced and incredibly
                        complex, the use of strategic visual components and creative details made the pieces digestible,
                        engaging, and informative.<br><br>

                        “Journeys through Gordonlandia” (tentative title) aims to use design strategies inspired by
                        McCloud, Appignanesi, and Zarate’s colorful and inspiring use of art and text to formulate
                        informational yet entertaining pieces. Through embarking on this fictional journey and
                        experiencing the immersive creative choices we hope to make through incorporating our tastes for
                        multimedia textures and styles, readers from the WPI community may experience a tasteful
                        exploration of the ILLiad program and the vast resources it offers us.<br><br>
